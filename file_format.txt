Beside this file, there are three PDB formatted files contained in the ZIP file.
Section III of this file lists the PDB format definitions.


I. Content of ZIP  ==================================================================

0) file_format.txt (this)
1) PDBID.vor.pdb
2) PDBID_holes.pdb
3) PDBID_neighbors.pdb


II. File formats   ==================================================================


1) PDBID.vor.pdb

This file contains the actual protein.

The b-factor entry in the ATOM section contains the packing density,
the occupancy entry the z-score (if defined).
The header provides general information, such as the exactness selected.
A value of 0.4 is the 'low accuracy' mode, a value of 0.8 the 'high accuracy' mode.
This is followed by the total z-score of the molecule.
Below there is information about the holes (cavities) , e.g. the atom ids forming the cavity.


2) PDBID_holes.pdb

This file contains pseudo-atoms, representing the cavities.

The B-factor contains the radius of the sphere. Its coordinates are in the usual xyz columns.
The occupancy entry contains an average of the hydrophobicity of the constituting residues.


3) PDBID_neighbors.pdb

This file contains all residues forming a cavity.
This is auxilary, for visualization purposes mainly.

The occupancy entry contains the hydrophobicity value of the given residue,
based on the Hessa scale. 


III. PDB definitions   ==============================================================

Voronoia exploits the ability of most molecular visualization softwares such as NGL
to color the molecule by b-factor or occupancy.

Voronoia writes information as described above into the b-factor and occupancy columns.
