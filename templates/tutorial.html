            <h3>Explore the Database</h3>

            <p>Voronoia contains a database of over 160.000 precalculated structures, including most of the structures found in the Protein Data Bank. You can browse these 
                structures in a table on the subpage <a href="database">database</a>.
            </p>
            
            <!-- img: db site -->
            
            <p>
            To search a specific entry, click on the search icon on the top right of the table and
                type in the PDB-ID of the structure you wish to view. </p>

            <!-- img: search db -->

            <p>Once you have found a structure to analyse, simply click on the entry in the table. You will be taken to the results subpage, where you can view and explore the
                data generated by Voronoia.
            </p>

            <h2>S U B M I T</h2>
            <h3>Upload own Structures</h3>

            <p>Since not all known macromolecular structures are deposited in the database and you may wish to analyse unpublished structures, you can submit a new structure for
                calculation under the <a href="submit">submit</a> subpage.
            </p>

            <!-- img: submit site -->
                
            <p>
                To submit your structure you first need to upload a pdb file. You can click on the green button 'Upload a PDB' to browse your filesystem for a file to be uploaded,
                or you can drag and drop a file into the grey box with the dashed outline.
            </p>

            <!-- img: uploading a pbd, open file manager -->

            <p>
                When you have uploaded a file, you will see a new form for submition. You can choose the set of atomic radii to be used in the calculation by clicking on the field 
                beneath the 'atom radii' label. Next you need to enter an id, a unique string which identifies your job unambiguously. If you want to be notified when your results
                are ready, you can optionally enter an email adress. 
            </p>

            <!-- img: filled out form -->

            <p>
                Once you have entered all required informations, you can click on the green submit button on the bottom of the page. You will now be redirected to the progress 
                site, where you can view the status of your job while it is in queue or being calculated.
            </p>

            <!-- img: progress site -->

            <p>
                The calculation may take a while (up to 15 minutes, exceptionally large structures taking even longer). You don't need to keep the tab open to access your results,
                as long as you copy the link shown on the page. When the calculation is finished, you will be redirected to the results subpage.
            </p>

            <h3>Analyse with Voronoia</h3>

            <p>In the results page you can view a structure that has been analysed with Voronoia. You can see a view box in the middle of the page, where the structure is shown
                as well as an array of balls with different sizes. These balls represent cavaties in the structure, which could potentially hold water molecules. Red balls indicate
                polar cavaties, which have a higher probability of containing water molecules, blue balls on the other hand represent cavaties which are mostly hydrophobic and 
                therefor less likely to hold water molecules. The atoms surrounding cavaties are highlighted, allowing you to investigate the cavaties on your own.
            </p>

            <p>
                The structure is colored by the packing density of the atoms, with red representing areas of low packing density and high flexibiliy, white showing average values of
                packing density and blue color indicating exceptionally rigid regions of the structure. Intermediate values are colored as mixed shades.
            </p>

            <!-- img: results -->

            <p>If you want to examine the structure in a bigger view box and with more powerful tools, you can click on the fullscreen icon located under the view box on the right.
                Clicking on the icon will open a fullscreen NGL-viewer with the structure, enabling you to change representations, load additional structures and much more. 
            </p>

            <!-- img: menu -->

            <p>You can also download the results as a zip file on the results subpage by clicking on the download icon under the view box. The zip file contains a vol file, an 
                extended vol file, a pdb file containing the cavaties as well as a 'selection' file which contains all atoms neighbouring cavaties.
            </p>

            <!-- img: zip file -->

            <p>Thank you for using Voronoia!</p>
